## About Me


I’m a full-stack developer and a former nurse specialising in Critical Care who has moved out of her comfort zone to learn software development at [Makers Academy](https://www.makersacademy.com/). 

I'm a curious person who is motivated by new challenges and learning from new experiences. This is one of the reasons why I moved from Spain to London four years ago and am now making the switch from a vocational career in nursing to learning to program and follow coding best-practice at Makers Academy.

My main goal after Makers is to join the software development team of a tech company contributing to achieving common goals, contributing to the creation of new projects and giving people the opportunity to interact with them.

## Skills


### Critical thinking

I'm used to work in critical situations where I need to apply specific protocols and guidelines, following an scientific and specific order of thinking  ABCDE ( Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability and Exposure) So, I'm able to use my experience  applying a methodical way of thinking. 

At Makers, I've learnt how to implement this skill into coding, breaking the problem down in small pieces using tools like flow charts,  diagrams and  domain models making a representation of the problem and the systematic approach.


### Teamplayer

Working as a part of a team is a must in Critical Care where everyone has to bring their best, sharing ideas and learning from others in order to achieve a common goal. 

Whilst at Makers, I've enjoyed learning from others and implementing a feedback culture to achieve common goals in a teamwork environment. This helps me to keep motivated and. For example, to facilitate collaborative teamwork, I've run daily stand-ups and retros as well as knowledge sharing sessions to encourage group discussion and ensure team members are aligned on our shared objectives.


### Commitment

I'm a focused and a passionate person who works hard towards an objective without giving up.
Whilst at Makers I had to face some challenges but I stayed motivated and I could accomplish my goals.


### Achievements and contributions

One of my biggest achievements in my career was my contribution to the growth of the Postoperative Care unit helping to create new guidelines and training new staff.

In Makers, one of my significants achievements was  working as a part of a team in a practice and final project, learning from others, contributing with ideas and getting a full-stack web application as a result.
