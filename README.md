## About Me


I’m a full-stack developer and a former nurse especialised in Critical Care, who has moved out of her confort zone to learn software development at [Makers Academy](https://www.makersacademy.com/). I'm a curious person, who likes facing new challenges and learning from new experiences, that's one of the reasons why I moved from sunny days in Spain to rainy days in London four years ago.

I chose nursing as a vocational career. However, I’ve decided to try something totally different learning to learn new languages and skills in Makers Academy. 

My main goal after Makers is to become a part of  the software development team in a Tech Company contributing to achieve common goals, helping with the creation of new projects and giving the people the opportunity to interact with them.

## Skills


### Critical thinking

I'm used to work in critical situations where I need to apply specific protocols and guidelines, following an scientific and specific order of thinking  ABCDE ( Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability and Exposure) So, I'm able to use my experience  applying a methodical way of thinking. 

At Makers, I've learnt how to implement this skill into coding, breaking the problem down in small pieces and implementing solutions step by step.


### Teamplayer

In Intensive Care, working as a part of a team is a must, everyone has to bring their best, sharing ideas and learning from others, in order to achieve a common goal. Improving the patient's condition.

Whilst at Makers, I've enjoyed learning from others sharing my experience and achieving common goals in a teamwork environment, implementing a feedback culture which helped me to keep motivated, developing my skills and achieving personal goals. An example of this could be the achievement of a practice project in five days.


### Commitment

I'm a focused and a passionate person who works hard towards an objective without giving up.
Whilst at Makers I had to face some challenges but I stayed motivated and I could accomplish my goals.


### Achievements and contributions

One of my biggest achievements in my career was my contribution to the growth of the Postoperative Care unit helping to create new guidelines and training new staff.

In Makers, one of my significants achievements was  working as a part of a team in a practice and final project, learning from others, contributing with ideas and getting a full-stack web application as a result.
