I’m a nurse especialised in Critical Care, who has moved out of her confort zone to learn software development in one of the Europe's Top Academy. I'm a curious person, who likes facing new challenges and learning from new experiences, that's one of the reasons why I moved from sunny days in Spain to rainny days in London four years ago.

For the past four years, I've been working in different areas of nursing obtaining clinical experience in Postoperative Care and Intensive Care. I'm a proactive and compassionate person who loves helping others to achieve their goals, this helped me to get a promotion of Band 6 Senior Staff nurse on 2016.

I chose nursing as a vocational career. However, I’ve decided to try something totally different learning new skills in the Tech field. I would like to help people combining my healthcare experience with all knowledge obtained in Makers Academy.


## Skills

#### Critical thinking

I'm used to work in critical situations where I need to apply specific protocols and guidelines, following an scientific and specific order of thinking  ABCDE ( Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability and Exposure) So, I'm able to use my experience  applying a methodical way of thinking. 

#### Teamwork

In Intensive Care, working as a part of a team is a must, everyone has to bring their best, sharing ideas and learning from others, in order to achieve a common goal. Improving the patient's condition.

Whilst at Makers, I've enjoyed learning from others sharing my experience in a teamwork environment, it helped me to keep motivated, developing my skills and achieving personal goals.


#### Achievements and contributions

One of my biggest achievements in my career was getting my post of Band 6 Senior Nurse and receiving positive feedbacks from my patients and colleagues, it kept me motivated.

I contributed to the growth of the Postoperative Care unit while working in Ealing Hospital, I helped to create new guidelines and trained new staff.

I've created a Whack a cookie game from scratch following the guide of Learn Game Programming with ruby ( The Pragmatic Programmers). Ckeck my github profile
